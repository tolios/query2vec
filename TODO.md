# TODOs

This file contains all needed milestones for completing the thesis project.

## Required code work

- choose how many of one structure to generate, specify test structure filter
- fix ndcg
- construct box rgcn (rgat)
- perhaps link convs with depth of query (?) 1p one conv, 2p two conv, 2i one conv

## Testings

- test all models
- check golden vs corrupted
- check different training vs testing datasets
- check 2 (or 3 datasets)
- check for bigger dag structures (5 edges or more!) (and if it is even relevant?)

## Extra (not pressingly important)

- construct 1p, 2p, 2i notation so as to check different structures?
- better sampling technique?
- test 1p, 2p, ... (like the papers)
