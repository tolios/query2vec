# TODOs

This file contains all needed milestones for completing the thesis project.

## Required code work

- Possibly required to contain all inverse relations! (r^{-1}) (done ?)
- find way to identify all equivalent answers (hash?) (? maybe done???)
- make metrics accurate (hits@K, MeanRank)
- construct mrr and ndcg metrics!
- construct box rgcn (rgat)

## Testings

- test all models
- check golden vs corrupted
- check different training vs testing datasets
- check 2 (or 3 datasets)
- check for bigger dag structures (5 edges or more!) (and if it is even relevant?)

## Extra (not pressingly important)
- construct 1p, 2p, 2i notation so as to check different structures?
- better sampling technique?
- test 1p, 2p, ... (like the papers)
